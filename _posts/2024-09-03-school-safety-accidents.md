***Analysis of School Safety Accidents in South Korea: *** 

***Exploring Efficient Compensation Strategies through the Analysis of Types of School Safety Incidents***


*The purpose of this project is to identify the types of incidents that incur the highest compensation through the correlation analysis between safety incidents and compensation. I aimed to gain insights into preventing specific types of incidents to efficiently reduce compensation payouts.*

*(Tableau visualization submitted to a big data competition hosted by the **Korean Ministry of Education**, and was selected to present to government officials.)*

# 1. Objective

This project's objective is to analyze and visualize K-12 school accidents to minimize government payout burdens.

# 2. Safety Incidents Analysis

First, let's examine the analysis of safety incidents in 2022.

Univariate analysis did not yield significant information, but one discovery through multivariate analysis is that most safety incidents occur in *"ancillary facilities"*. 

While it's expected for incidents to occur frequently in sports fields due to being school safety incidents, the *unexpected result is that the most incidents happen in ancillary facilities, with special attention to the inclusion of "**auditorium**" in this category*.

# 3. Compensation Analysis

Second, the analysis of compensation in 2022.

The derived information here is that the number of compensation payouts is highest in the order of *elementary > middle > high school*, but *the total amount is the opposite*. 

When measuring the average amount per case, the amount for **high schools** is the highest. Hence, I decided to focus on safety incidents involving high school students.

# 4. Safety Incidents x Compensation Analysis
Lastly, the analysis of safety incidents and compensation in 2022.

Detailed data on payment scale was lacking, so I referred to the 2022 School Safety Incident Analysis Statistics Report published by the School Safety Deduction Central Association. 

The types of incidents with high payment scales were *hand & foot accidents*, during physical education classes, and ball sports. It's also noteworthy that, a significant number of those kinds of incidents occur in the auditorium as well. 

When examining the accident types, *collisions with objects, slips and falls* were most prevalent. Notably, considering the auditorium has a *wooden floor*, most slips and falls incidents can be predicted to occur there.

# 5. Conclusion

In conclusion, the key keywords from this project's analysis are "*high school students*," "*physical education classes*," "*auditorium*," and "*hand & foot*."

# 6. Suggestion

To address this, implementing anti-slip measures on the auditorium's wooden floor, mandating stretching before physical education classes, and smoothing uneven facilities within the school premises are suggested. This will likely reduce safety incidents and efficiently decrease compensation payouts.
